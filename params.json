The method generates numeric score for each residue in the input protein sequence that quantifies putative propensity to form a DFL. Larger value of propensity denotes higher likelihood to form DFL. It also provides putative binary annotations (a given residue is predicted either as a DFL or not a DFL) based on false positive rate = 0.05 using threshold on the propensity score = 0.18). Residues with propensity > 0.18 are assumed to form DFLs and otherwise they are assumed not to form DFLs.  \r\n\r\n#System requirement\r\nJava Runtime Environment 1.5 or later\r\n\r\n#Usage (command line)\r\njava -jar DFLpred.jar [input_fasta_file] [output_file]  \r\nAccepts up to 5000 FASTA sequences in a single fasta file\r\n\r\n#Example\r\njava -jar DFLpred.jar examples.fasta results.txt\r\n\r\n#Format of results\r\nLine 1: >protein ID  \r\nLine 2: protein sequence using 1-letter amino acid encoding.
